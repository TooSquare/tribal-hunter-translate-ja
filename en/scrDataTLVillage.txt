		"TLdiagkeyhivegate4": "Most runes will work, but most have been lost with time.",
		"TLdiagkeyhivegate5": "Is there any possibility of finding one?",
		"TLdiagkeyhivegate6": "I think your only chance of finding one will be to go to the old kingdom on the eastern side of the island.",
		"TLdiagkeyhivegate7": "A great wizard resided there during its prime. She ended up being a pretty big artifact hoarder, though.",
		"TLdiagkeyhivegate8": "The kingdom was decimated by some unknown cause, leaving it a literal ghost town.",
		"TLdiagkeyhivegate9": "Based on that, I would assume that same wizard hoarded a rune or two. Look for the tower.",

		"keymunchsq2": "Uh, no... but I can order some if you'd like on my phone.",

		"TLdiagkeypotcontest6": "I can totally make this no problem!",

		"TLdiagkeyupgrade3": "If you'd be willing to invest, I'll open more purchasing options!",
		"TLdiagkeyupgrade4": "I think 3000 gold is all I'd need for the permitting and what not.",

		"TLdiagshamanchatC2": "That Boarus stood no chance!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatC3": "I knew he would be a mere inconvenience to you!",
		"TLdiagshamanchatD1": "The slime king has been a recurring obstacle to those seeking power here.",

		"TLdiagsisterchatE1": "So the Ocean Sapphire was guarded by a crystal golem huh?",
		"TLdiagsisterchatE2": "I guess a sharp, solid giant is more difficult to deal with than slime.",

		"TLdiagvillageguardD1": "We have received word of a powerful foe elsewhere in the mines.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardD2": "It emanates some sort of magical energy.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardE1": "The caverns are secure. The beach is next... riddled with pirates.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardE2": "You can be taken there by Gordo to the west of the village.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardF1": "The pirates have been weakened... and we have received word of Darkdread being spotted in the Shadowlands.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardF2": "Subdue him... East of the beach, and through the jungle.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardG1": "Darkdread will be defeated in time... For now, we have identified a new threat...",
		"TLdiagvillageguardG2": "At the tower to the east of the Shadowlands is a very powerful ghost that has a magical item we seek...",
		"TLdiagvillageguardH1": "There appears to be a large hive located near the mountains...",
		"TLdiagvillageguardH2": "While not an immediate threat, it could transform into one.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardI1": "The only threat that remains is Darkdread...",
		"TLdiagvillageguardI2": "His castle is located at the top of the mountains... Good luck...",
		
		"TLdiagvillageguardfinal1": "I guess this is your purpose.",
		"TLdiagvillageguardfinal2": "The shaman has great faith that you will prevail.",
		"TLdiagtipvillage1": "Want to view some of my tips?",
		"TLdiagtorialtar1": "Ah, Munch!",
		"TLdiagtorialtar2": "I have heeded your call!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarchatvillage1": "This here is the ancient village of the island.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarchatvillage2": "It is home to us and the source of the island's wisdom!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarchatwatchyourstep1": "This is the heart of the Piglands.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarchatwatchyourstep2": "It was given this name by the pigs during their conquest, of course.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarchatwatchyourstep3": "This area is controlled by rogues and bandits alike!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarPL41": "The Piglands branches toward the Great Mountain here.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarPL42": "It is both majestic and dangerous.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarPL43": "I doubt the pigs were able to venture near it!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarpigmines1": "These caverns were formed by the island's latent energy.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarpigmines2": "Seen merely as treasure, these gems are worth far more spiritually!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarpigmines3": "It seems the pigs do not understand that, though.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarpighideoutA1": "This dense area is where the king of pigs Boarus resides.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarpighideoutA2": "It is intended to be hidden and out of sight, but Boarus' bravado does a poor job of concealing it.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarpighideoutA3": "I mean think about it... you just walked right in!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarbeachresort1": "The northern beach is rife with relaxation.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarbeachresort2": "The pirates have made vacationing here near impossible though...",
		"TLdiagtorialtarbeachresort3": "At least this resort seems to be a sanctuary though!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarjungleB1": "The jungle bridges the land between the Beach and Shadowlands.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarjungleB2": "The farther in you go, the denser it becomes!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarjungleB3": "It seems even the pirates are wary of trekking too far in...",
		"TLdiagtorialtarhiveshrine1": "Very few know of this hive's existance...",
		"TLdiagtorialtarhiveshrine2": "A growing army, swelling in secrecy...",
		"TLdiagtorialtarhiveshrine3": "They must not be too happy to see you in here!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarghostcitypath1": "The Shadowlands was once a densely populated utopia.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarghostcitypath2": "A city far more advanced than the village in terms of architecture.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarghostcitypath3": "All that has come to an end, though...",
		"TLdiagtorialtarghostcitypath4": "I have only heard rumors, but they say the population eradicated itself in a mere day!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarghostcitypath5": "A whole city brought to complete ruin!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarcemetary1": "This is the central cemetery of the city.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarcemetary2": "It seems to reside deep in the city, close to the main structures and districts.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarcemetary3": "It gives me the heebie-jeebies...",
		"TLdiagtorialtarmount41": "This respite on the edge of the cliff provided a restful spot for many a traveler.",
		"TLdiagtorialtarmount42": "Many put their life on the line climbing this mountain...",
		"TLdiagtorialtarmount43": "This spot is a point of inspiration that proves it can be done!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarmount101": "Ahh we're nearing the peak!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarmount102": "The Serpent's Cavern is one of the last stretches to the top!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarmount141": "Ahh the foot of the castle!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarmount142": "It's probably pretty dangerous inside, so make sure you're stocked up on supplies!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarcastlebalc1": "Who knew the castle had its own shrine up here?",
		"TLdiagtorialtarcastlebalc2": "Oh wait, I did!",
		"TLdiagtorialtarcastlebalc3": "Royalty gets mail too!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillage1": "This village has existed for generations.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillage2": "The island itself used to be a very popular tourist destination.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillage3": "Merchants and travelers would pass through and bring a more eccentric vibe to this place!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillage4": "Unfortunately, selfishness has taken hold of the other factions here.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillage5": "It's difficult to trade and sustain a population now.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillage6": "But that's why you're here!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers1": "There aren't many permanent residents anymore...",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers10": "The guildmaster also creates all of our beautiful dyes.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers11": "She's out doing field research.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers11a": "I think she's finished most of her field research so she should be right up at the guild tent!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers12": "I think she was looking for special glowing crystals or something!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers13": "To-ri is our courier and transportation.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers14": "I don't know where he could have gone.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers15": "I haven't seen him in a few days... He must be in the Piglands somewhere, though.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers14a": "He has a house perched up on the western cliff.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers15a": "If you need to go somewhere fast, call him at the bird statue near the altar!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers16": "Gordo lives on the western beach and used to give water transportation to tourists.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers17": "I wish I knew how to get him to offer rides again...",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers17a": "You seemed to have inspired him to travel again! That's awesome!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers18": "Key is a wandering merchant that set up shop here in town.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers19": "I think you're acquainted with him already!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers20": "Sugar and Sunblaze are visitors.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers21": "They enjoyed the Bountiful Harvest Festival so much that they extended their vacation here!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers22": "Lastly theres that old lizard man...",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers23": "He showed up shortly after you came to be!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers2": "But we cherish those that we have!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers24": "He must be more than a mere drifter... Perhaps he knows more about you than us!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers25": "...",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers26": "And I think that covers the residents!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers3": "My family coordinates most of what the village does.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers4": "Grandpa is the head shaman, my brother runs the farm, and my sister handles construction.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers5": "Grandma runs our only restraunt.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers6": "She's usually out hunting and gathering in the Piglands.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers6a": "She decided to outsource some of the gathering work to the guards so she's now at the joint permanently!",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers7": "Hmm... We also have a small artist's guild.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers8": "The artists enjoy painting helpful advice.",
		"TLdiagyisyaaboutvillagers9": "Ask them about it if you see them!",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest1": "That was quite the match!",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest2": "Sorry you couldnt stomach that last bite though...",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest3": "You've seen the contest before, right?",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest4": "Do you know any way I can gain an edge for the rematch?",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest5": "Hmm... Yeah...",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest6": "If I recall, there was a special solution competitors used in the past.",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest7": "I dont remember what it was called, but it was pretty hard to make.",
		"TLdiagyisyaeatingcontest8": "I think you would need to find a craftsman to do it. That goat guy seems pretty crafty!",
		"TLdiagyisyahivegate1": "Hmm... there's an ancient gate up there?",
		"TLdiagyisyahivegate2": "I've heard about old artifacts, but we at the tribe are pretty disconnected from the past.",
		"TLdiagyisyahivegate3": "Have you met anyone in that area? They would know more than us.",
		"TLdiagyisyameet1": "Wow, I can't believe you're real!",
		"TLdiagyisyameet2": "You look exactly like my old doll!",
		"TLdiagyisyameet3": "Thanks for summoning me!",
		"TLdiagyisyameet4": "I'll do my best to restore your village.",
		"TLdiagyisyameet5": "I'm so glad my granddad's effort wasn't in vain.",
		"TLdiagyisyameet6": "My name's Yisya, and I'll try to help you out as best I can!",
		"TLdiagyisyameet7": "I can make more dolls incase your current form falls apart!",
		"TLdiagyisychatA1": "Wow... I can still hardly believe you're real!",
		"TLdiagyisychatA2": "It's like a dream!",
		"TLdiagyisychatA3": "Feel free to ask me anything!",
		"TLdiagyisychatB1": "Hey, Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatB2": "How is the island treating you so far?",
		"TLdiagyisychatC1": "Hey, Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatC2": "I heard you gave Boarus quite the beating!",
		"TLdiagyisychatC3": "That will knock him down a few pegs!",
		"TLdiagyisychatD1": "Hey, Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatD2": "You're really living up to your fame!",
		"TLdiagyisychatD3": "I can't believe you managed to tame the king of slimes!",
		"TLdiagyisychatE1": "Hey, Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatE2": "Word's gotten around that you found the fabled Ocean Sapphire!",
		"TLdiagyisychatE3": "The pigs have been looking for that for awhile, but I guess you beat them to it!",
		"TLdiagyisychatF1": "Hey, Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatF2": "The pirates have been splintering off into smaller factions on the shores.",
		"TLdiagyisychatF3": "I'll assume you threw a wrench into their power structure, eh?",
		"TLdiagyisychatG1": "Hey, I felt your defeat to Lord Dread...",
		"TLdiagyisychatG2": "Keep your head up and keep moving!",
		"TLdiagyisychatG3": "The gifts you have will allow you to prevail, you just need to hone them more!",
		"TLdiagyisychatH1": "Hey Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatH2": "Now that you've subdued the Ghost Queen, the lost city will lay to rest.",
		"TLdiagyisychatH3": "Maybe it can be reinhabited one day...",
		"TLdiagyisychatI1": "Hey Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatI2": "I heard you faced off against a huge queen bee!",
		"TLdiagyisychatI3": "Didn't get stung too much, I hope!",
		"TLdiagyisyacaverns1": "Hmm... We've noticed disturbances coming from down below.",
		"TLdiagyisyacaverns2": "I think it's worth looking into.",
		"TLdiagyisyacaverns3": "There's an entrance to an old mine in the Piglands at the fork!",
		"TLdiagyisyacaverns4": "It might be blocked off... but you're more than capable of smashing in!",
		"TLdiagyisyacaverns5": "Could you go check it out?",
		"TLdiagyisychatfinal1": "It's great to have you back, Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisychatfinal2": "I was so worried we wouldn't see you again...",
		"TLdiagyisychatfinal3": "But my faith continues to deliver!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland1": "The island has felt so weird since your summit with Darkdread...",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland2": "The blast afterwards threw us all for a loop!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland3": "Yeah... the spirit wasn't happy with what I did in that seal room...",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland4": "I think she expected me to become the new seal.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland5": "What?!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland6": "Well... I'm glad you didn't.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland7": "My grandpa saw something else in the cards for you.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland8": "He once told me that you would put the evil of the island at rest.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalisland9": "At first he didn't really understand the meaning... but I think he does now.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalplan1": "We've been planning for everything once the island takeover began by Darkdread.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalplan2": "Even now, that's no different.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalplan3": "If things go truly dire, we will get away!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalplan4": "Hopefully escape won't be necessary.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalplan5": "Now that the island's full power is released, I must face it head on.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalplan6": "I know I can do this!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalplan7": "We believe in you, Munch!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit1": "We saw that wierd spirit lady blast from the castle with a ray of light!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit2": "We thought you were toast for sure... but I saw you flicker through the air as we escaped.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit3": "Seeing your doll was actually reassuring...",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit4": "I knew your spirit must have escaped after the blast!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit5": "Yeah... The energy up there was extremely intense.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit6": "Did you see where the spirit went?",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit7": "She flew into the sky and screamed!",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit8": "She seemed extremely angry... but also sad.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit9": "I have no idea what she's planning next...",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit10": "There was an extreme darkness hidden inside the castle.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit11": "She must be angry with me for freeing it...",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit12": "Somehow... me and grandpa know that freeing it was the right choice.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit13": "He receives the prophecies from the island itself... but always feels conflict.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit14": "Like the sealing by the ancient ones caused more harm than good.",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit15": "The moment might feel dire... but it must be part of a greater plan...",
		"TLdiagyisyafinalspirit16": "One that you're the star player in!",
