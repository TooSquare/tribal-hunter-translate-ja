		"triggerarthuman10": "If she's in there somewhere, I'll find her.",
		"triggerarthuman11": "That's relieving to hear.",
		"triggerarthuman12": "Thank you.",
		"triggerarthuman13": "I'll head back and leave this in your hands then.",
		"triggerarthuman14": "But before I go, I have some tips for your viewing!",
		"triggerarthuman15": "Let me know and I'll show you what I have.",
		"triggerarthuman16": "Oh, thanks!",
		"triggerarthuman2": "Oh, hello!",
		"triggerarthuman3": "I'm a member of the artist's guild.",
		"triggerarthuman4": "We're out in the world looking for inspiration!",
		"triggerarthuman5": "We?",
		"triggerarthuman6": "I'm seeing only you here.",
		"triggerarthuman7": "About that...",
		"triggerarthuman8": "I came here with our guildmaster, but we've been seperated.",
		"triggerarthuman9": "I've been waiting here at the exit for her to turn up, but she hasn't...",
		"triggerfirstvialmeet1": "Hello there, traveller.",
		"triggerfirstvialmeet2": "If you wish to proceed, sate my hunger with slime!",
		"triggerfirstvialmeet3": "How do I do that?",
		"triggerfirstvialmeet4": "I'm sure you can bring it to me somehow.",
		"triggerfirstvialmeet5": "Have you tried eating some?",
		"triggerfirstvialmeet6": "Some pigs have learned to shoot the slime as a weapon!",
		"triggerfirstvialmeet7": "I guess I'll give that a shot...",
		"triggerfoxcaveB1": "You made it through!",
		"triggerfoxcaveB2": "Was my advice useful?",
		"triggerfoxcaveB3": "He he he!",
		"triggerfoxcaveB4": "You're really asking for it, you trickster!",
		"triggerfoxcaveB5": "You silly plush... ",
		"triggerfoxcaveB6": "You really think you can beat me, don't you?",
		"triggerfoxcaveB7": "Well, why don't you go ahead and try!",
		"triggerfoxcaveB8": "I'll be waiting...",
		"triggerfoxcavea1": "Oh ho...",
		"triggerfoxcavea2": "It's you again.",
		"triggerfoxcavea3": "You've come to seek the mine's fortune, haven't you?",
		"triggerfoxcavea4": "What's it to you?",
		"triggerfoxcavea5": "Heeeeey, work on that tone, won't you?",
		"triggerfoxcavea6": "This cave is pretty dangerous...",
		"triggerfoxcavea7": "You may want to take the RIGHT path... hehe!",
		"triggerraccooncaveB1": "Oh hello, it's you again!",
		"triggerraccooncaveB10": "It acts like a hive-mind for all slimes.",
		"triggerraccooncaveB11": "Looks like I'll have to sever those ties, then.",
		"triggerraccooncaveB2": "Oh hey!",
		"triggerraccooncaveB3": "I see you've made it pretty far underground.",
		"triggerraccooncaveB4": "Those pig miners are so mean.",
		"triggerraccooncaveB5": "They shook me down for an entrance fee!",
		"triggerraccooncaveB6": "They act like they own the place!",
		"triggerraccooncaveB7": "That figures...",
		"triggerraccooncaveB8": "They somehow have an allegiance with the slime creatures here...",
		"triggerraccooncaveB9": "It must have something to do with the slime overlord.",
		"triggerslimekingroom1": "Gah, look what you've done!",
		"triggerslimekingroom10": "The pigs are biologically inferior.",
		"triggerslimekingroom11": "I figured that if I gave them a free pass in my domain, they could extend their reach and I could take it from them later.",
		"triggerslimekingroom12": "At least that's what the dragon man seems to think.",
		"triggerslimekingroom13": "Anyways... I think we can help eachother out in a positive way.",
		"triggerslimekingroom14": "What do you mean?",
		"triggerslimekingroom15": "You're aware of your own powers, yes?",
		"triggerslimekingroom16": "I can help you extend those.",
		"triggerslimekingroom17": "I can increase your capacity to unlock a larger form than you can reach.",
		"triggerslimekingroom18": "What do you get out of that, though?",
		"triggerslimekingroom19": "I'll need a fee for my service...",
		"triggerslimekingroom2": "I'm microscopic!",
		"triggerslimekingroom20": "But I can also tap into your energy to regrow myself.",
		"triggerslimekingroom21": "Simply engaging your spirit can rejuvinate my cellular structure.",
		"triggerslimekingroom22": "Hmm... I guess that's agreeable.",
		"triggerslimekingroom23": "I may need to be larger than before to face the challenges ahead.",
		"triggerslimekingroom24": "Good.",
		"triggerslimekingroom25": "Here are the requirements for this transaction:",
		"triggerslimekingroom26": "I'll need 3000 coins from you, and you'll also have to be able to support a capacity of at least 430.",
		"triggerslimekingroom27": "It looks like you'll have to boost your capacity a little before I can help.",
		"triggerslimekingroom28": "Try finding magic mushrooms. They can permanently increase your capacity up to a point.",
		"triggerslimekingroom29": "Reach 430 capacity, bring 3000 coins, and we'll perform the ritual.",
		"triggerslimekingroom30": "It looks like your capacity will be high enough.",
		"triggerslimekingroom31": "Make sure your stomach is empty and that you have 3000 coins, and we'll perform the ritual.",
		"triggerslimekingroom3": "You really shouldn't pick a fight with a guardian.",
		"triggerslimekingroom4": "It doesn't matter how big you are.",
		"triggerslimekingroom5": "Well, here to finish the job then?",
		"triggerslimekingroom6": "Going to step on me or something?",
		"triggerslimekingroom7": "I don't think that's necessary.",
		"triggerslimekingroom8": "Just stop harrassing the islanders and helping the pigs.",
		"triggerslimekingroom9": "Psh... It's not like I even want to.",
