		"ExplLdAbout2": "For all it takes is one encouraged spark of positive motivation, to really fire up someone's true adventurous spirit.",
		"ExplLdCaverns1": "I've gotten a report from our faithful racoon explorer, for he's provided us some info while near the entrance.",
		"ExplLdCaverns2": "We can now confirm it's quite inhabited, as he's heard various animalistic sounds emanate from the cave's main opening.",
		"ExplLdCaverns3": "But if that's where you're going next on your adventure, then I wish you all the best for what you might find there!",
		"ExplLdChat1": "Aha! What do you need, new recruit?",
		"ExplLdOther1": "Eager to known more huh?",
		"ExplLdOther2": "Hehe, well I do have one more bit of info that might pique your interest while out there.",
		"ExplLdOther3": "When you do eventually leave these woods, you'll need to enter the island's vast mountain range at the upper path ahead.",
		"ExplLdOther4": "Upon entry, continue to take the first path you see forward until you reach a cliff facing left of you.",
		"ExplLdOther5": "Climb it and you'll meet a rather interesting character, a pink dragon explorer resides atop that area of the cliffside.",
		"ExplLdOther6": "I'd recommend going there if you ever feel like needing a small break from your adventure, never hurts to blow off some steam after a long day of exploring.",
		"ExplLdOther7": "Along with definitely brightening up his day by meeting eagerly adventurous folk like yourself.",
		"ExplLdOutfitA1": "Going for a more practical outfit eh?",
		"ExplLdOutfitA2": "I'd be more than happy to provide you with one!",
		"ExplLdOutfitA3": "Let's get you all geared up!",

		"ExplLdPOI2": "Hopefully this'll be of help during your travels through these woods.",
		"ExplLdPOI3": "Recently, I've received a bit of information from a fellow member of ours who's stationed there, as they've discovered a large cave opening at the down path ahead.",

		"TLdiagBoardefeat29": "Well, I'm off!",
		"TLdiagBoardefeat3": "Oh, wow.",
		"TLdiagBoardefeat30": "Keep me entertained, won't you?",

		"TLdiagKitoraarrange1": "Ready to take flight?",
		"TLdiagKitoraflightcourseA1": "This course is made using the island's natural hazards to create a fun, challenging adventure.",
		"TLdiagKitoraflightcourseA2": "Its primary purpose is to introduce the joy of flight to the flightless!",
		"TLdiagKitoraflightcourseA3": "The rewards are an added bonus as well!",
		"TLdiagKitoraflightcourseB1": "This course uses the gooey nature of the caverns against you!",
		"TLdiagKitoraflightcourseB2": "You'll have to dodge things being thrown at you from all angles!",
		"TLdiagKitoraflightcourseC1": "This course is full of crystal formations and enemies.",
		"TLdiagKitoraflightcourseC2": "There aren't too many spaces you can fit through!",
		"TLdiagKitorahow1": "The course is simple!",
		"TLdiagKitorahow2": "Use your movement controls to drift around the course and avoid obstacles.",
		"TLdiagKitorahow3": "Keep your inflation level balanced so you don't deflate, nor explode!",
		"TLdiagKitorahow4": "It sounds dangerous, but I promise you that all my students make it out intact!",
		"TLdiagKitoralose1": "Good try!",
		"TLdiagKitoralose2": "It definitely takes some practice!",
		"TLdiagKitoralose3": "Try as many times as you like!",
		"TLdiagKitorameet1": "Hello stranger!",
		"TLdiagKitorameet10": "And best of all... REWARDS!",
		"TLdiagKitorameet11": "It sounds interesting...",
		"TLdiagKitorameet12": "How does it work?",
		"TLdiagKitorameet13": "Well... clearly flight is not a trait many have to enjoy.",
		"TLdiagKitorameet14": "I provide my students with a magic potion that inflates them and gives them an upward lift!",
		"TLdiagKitorameet15": "The effect can be enhanced by food items during the course, but can also be weakened by getting knocked around.",
		"TLdiagKitorameet16": "The key is to keep your inflation level at a comfortable balance!",
		"TLdiagKitorameet17": "All you need to do is drift in the direction you want to go and make it to the end!",
		"TLdiagKitorameet18": "Sounds like a fun experience!",
		"TLdiagKitorameet19": "It sure is!",
		"TLdiagKitorameet2": "Hello, who might you be?",
		"TLdiagKitorameet20": "Talk to me again and we'll arrange a run through the course!",
		"TLdiagKitorameet3": "I go by Kitora!",
		"TLdiagKitorameet4": "As you may have seen from my sign, I'm operating a flight course!",
		"TLdiagKitorameet5": "A flight course?",
		"TLdiagKitorameet6": "Indeed!",
		"TLdiagKitorameet7": "This island has so many unique wonders and facets to it.",
		"TLdiagKitorameet8": "There was a lot to work with for setting my course up!",
		"TLdiagKitorameet9": "It has... Action! Peril! Suspense!",
		"TLdiagKitorameetb1": "Hello! Are you interested in trying the course?",
		"TLdiagKitorawin1": "Wow, you are a really talented floater!",
		"TLdiagKitorawin2": "I cant believe you knocked out my entire course!",
		"TLdiagKitorawin3": "Well done!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerA1": "Hiya, sir!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerA10": "All of our maps contain both an overview for direction and also a precise positioning system that points out hazardous foes!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerA11": "Open the map, and you can move left and right to switch between modes!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerA12": "I hope it helps you out on your adventure!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerA13": "This seems very useful, thank you so much!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerA14": "No Problem! Good luck and be careful out there sir!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerA2": "Hey! Are you the map maker here?",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerA3": "Yes sir!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerA4": "I'm the cadet cartographer of the Explorer's Guild!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerA5": "I'm still sort of new to this area, but I've already fallen in love with the island, its people, and the local cuisine!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerA6": "I can't stop stuffing myself at all the restaurants, food stands, and cafes!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerA7": "Hehe!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerA8": "Anyways, I just finished creating my first draft map of the entire island with the help of our members.",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerA9": "I need an explorer like yourself to give it a field test!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerB1": "I hope you're enjoying the sights, sounds, smells and snacks of the isle sir!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerB2": "I want to continue my cartography training by exploring other islands that have yet to be mapped out!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerB3": "If you find any new and interesting areas, let me know!",
		"TLdiagYCHcartographerB4": "Also, if you find any new and tasty restaurants with a big menu, let me know SOONER!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerbetamt1": "Right on!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerbetamt2": "How much you wanna bet?",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerbetchecksh1": "Looks like you're a bit short for that bet!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerbetcheck1": "Alrighty!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerbetcheck2": "Now make your choice!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerchat1": "Wanna make some cash?",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerchat2": "Let's roll the dice!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerhowto1": "Pick a face from the die!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerhowto2": "I'll then roll 2 dice, and if your chosen face matches either, you get a payout!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerhowto3": "Matching one face triples your money, and matching both gives you a x10 return!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerhowto4": "You can bet 10, 50, or 100 gold!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerrewardA1": "Ahh... No matches.",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerrewardA2": "Nice try though!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerrewardA3": "Wanna give it another go?",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerrewardB1": "We have a match!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerrewardB2": "Congrats!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerrewardB3": "Thats a x3 payout for you!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerrewardC1": "Holy supercow!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerrewardC2": "A double match!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerrewardC3": "Thats a x10 payout for you!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerroll1": "All locked in!",
		"TLdiagYCHgamblerroll2": "Let's see what your luck has in store!",
		"TLdiagYCHmountainhealer1": "Hey again.",
		"TLdiagYCHmountainhealer2": "Do you need healing?",
		"TLdiagYCHmountainhealerabout1": "Who are you anyways?",
		"TLdiagYCHmountainhealerabout2": "Me?",
		"TLdiagYCHmountainhealerabout3": "Well, the name's Jonathan and I'm just a humble adventurer.",
		"TLdiagYCHmountainhealerabout4": "I journey around hoping to find rumors or discoveries of great interest.",
		"TLdiagYCHmountainhealerabout5": "I also studied healing magic on my travels, so I'm able to help the people I find.",
		"TLdiagYCHmountainhealerabout6": "Part of the reason I'm on this island is because of the hardships currently being endured here.",

		"TLdiagsavedgrannycook1": "Oh ho, looks like you pack a punch, don't you?",
		"TLdiagsavedgrannycook10": "I might look like an old geezer but I'm quite strong for my age.",

		"TLdiagsavedkey2": "Are you okay?",
		"TLdiagsavedkey20": "Using tough grip strength, you can also slide down walls slowly.",
		"TLdiagsavedkey21": "I'll be able to teach you more abilities for a fee.",
		"TLdiagsavedkey22": "I guess I'll set up shop in your village!",
		"TLdiagsavedkey23": "Oh yeah, here's one more gift!",
